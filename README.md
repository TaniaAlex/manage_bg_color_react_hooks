### Change State using React Hooks, Mouse Events and CSS in JS libraries

Manage a background colour of the component using React Hooks, onMouseEnter and onMouseOut events.

### React Hooks useState

The only argument to the useState() Hook is the initial state
Use JavaScript syntax “array destructuring”

- Unlike with classes, the state doesn’t have to be an object
- We can keep a number or a string if that’s all we need

### Dependencies

- Emotion JS library

npm i emotion

Emotion is CSS in JS framework. Key benefits:

- Both string and object styles are supported.
- Add, change and delete CSS without any unexpected consequences
- Has support for auto vendor-prefixing, nested selectors, and media queries.
- Dynamically change the colors of the fonts and background.
